# CHAOSS App Ecosystem Working Group

---

ðŸš¨ The CHAOSS App Ecosystem WG goes on a hiatus for the holidays. Last meeting will be November 15, 2021 and we resume meetings on January 13, 2022. 

In the meantime, we advance our work and coordinate asynchronously via Matrix ([join the conversation](https://matrix.to/#/!jfzkFKyGWrODFcwpLp:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=kde.org&via=t2bot.io)).

## Introduction

The mission of this working group is to build a base set of metrics that is focused on the needs of open source communities that are part of the FOSS app ecosystem.

## Background

### Problem Statement

The diversity of FOSS is vast and there are many different kinds of communities out there. Some projects are modest with 5-6 contributors working on something in their spare time. Some are the foundation of a company where hundreds or thousands of developers are working on them. This working group is focused on communities that are a combination of both. Aspirational projects that scale to hundreds or thousands of contributors that require community management that have different goals and decision making than a corporate backed or inner source project but still requires sophisticated metrics.


### Opportunity

This is a gap that we believe should be filled by building an alliance amongst major stakeholders to build a metrics standard amongst a class of communities that have never actually built the level of sophistication before. As these tech communities migrate to more sophisticated development platforms like Gitlab - it's possible to start building foundational technologies that we can build on.


### Goal

The goals of the working group is to build a base set of metrics that can shared amongst a set of communities (today that is GNOME and KDE) that we can then build upon for other communities.


## Objectives

A few key objectives:
* Document and explore the decisions that we make that we need metrics to explore
* Build a set of metrics from those decisions
* Present those metrics to the CHAOSS community for feedback
